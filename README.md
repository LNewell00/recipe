 Day 1:
    Created and set up index, styles, and few images that I liked.
    Not finished with landing page but have a small idea of what I want, still trying to figure out all the kinks with it however.

    Plan is to do half purple, and half Cream.
    Text will be black with white accent.
    On the right half of the screen will be an image, while the left will have text.
